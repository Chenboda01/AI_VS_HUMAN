# Project Guidelines for AI_VS_HUMAN

## Game-Specific Patterns

- The game is turn-based with 10 turns per player
- AI uses a multi-objective algorithm (answer questions, send troops, defend)
- Human player has the same capabilities as AI

## Code Style

- Use ES6+ features (arrow functions, destructuring, async/await)
- Write pure functions when possible
- Keep UI logic separate from game logic
- Use event delegation for dynamic elements
